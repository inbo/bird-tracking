This query retrieves UvA-BiTS gps data in the Movebank data format
(https://www.movebank.org/node/2381#data). It queries detections in
ee_(shared_)tracking_speed_limited that fall within a
ee_(shared_)track_session_limited for a specific ring_number.

Upload resulting data to Movebank as:
Tracking data > GPS data > custom GPS data

The UvA-BiTS fields that could not be mapped to Movebank are:

gps.x_speed                             Opted to use speed_2d (based on x_speed) instead
gps.y_speed                             Opted to use speed_2d (based on y_speed) instead
gps.z_speed                             Cannot be mapped: is z ground speed measured by tag in m/s
gps.speed_accuracy                      Cannot be mapped: is accuracy measured by tag on those speeds
gps.speed_3d                            Cannot be mapped: is ground speed calculated from x_speed,
                                        y_speed and z_speed
gps.location                            Not relevant: postgreSQL geometry
gps.altitude_agl                        Not relevant: is recorded altitude minus reference
                                        digital elevation model
