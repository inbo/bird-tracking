This query retrieves UvA-BiTS acceleration data in the Movebank data format
(https://www.movebank.org/node/2381#data). It queries accelerations in
ee_(shared_)acceleration_limited that fall within a
ee_(shared_)track_session_limited for a specific ring_number.

Upload resulting data to Movebank as:
Accessory data > Other accessory data collected by your tags

The UvA-BiTS fields that could not be mapped to Movebank are:

acc.index                               Not necessary: is converted to milliseconds in timestamp

Note that the table ee_(shared)_acc_start_limited is not used either: it contains timestamps for
acceleration measurements that do not have an associated GPS fix:

acc_start.device_info_serial            Not necessary, same as acc.device_info_serial
acc_start.date_time                     Not necessary, same as acc.date_time
acc_start.line_counter                  Not necessary
acc_start.timesynced                    Not necessary
acc_start.accii                         Not necessary
acc_start.accsn                         Not necessary
acc_start.f                             Not necessary
